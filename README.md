# contest

This repository contains the source code of my attempts to solve problems from contests and problem sets available online.

To prepare environment, clone the `algo` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhukovdm/algo.git
```

Then, run `make` to create soft link to the `algo` inside `/usr/local/include/` and generate `VS Code` snippets.
