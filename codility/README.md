# Codility

Custom editor tracking all changes made. `using namespace std;` is written already. The default template advices "you can use includes", but the system already sees `vector`, `sort`, or `max`. Code analysis does not work for `C++20`, but works well for `C++14`. Test results are shown after submission, tests and given concise description, but actual tests are hidden.
