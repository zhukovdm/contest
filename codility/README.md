# Codility

Custom editor tracking all changes made. `using namespace std;` is hidden. The default template advices "you can use includes", but the system already sees `vector`, `sort`, or `max`. Code analysis does not work for `C++20`, but works well for `C++14`. Test results are shown after submission, tests and given concise description, but actual tests are hidden.

Only `SQLite` and `PostgreSQL` are available for `SQL` tasks.

In my opinion, the hardness estimation of *lesson* tasks is not useful.

According to the Codility set of rules, it is possible to use any IDE (e.g. with proper autocomplete support) and copy code into the editor, but cheating (unauthorized aid, plagiarism, etc.) is prohibited.
